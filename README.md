# _Save The Date - a medicines management native app (Server side)_

### About this part of project 

For the server side of this project, I've been using Express.js for building the server, MongoDB as a database, mongoose to connect the server and database, and Firebase, for authentication and storage. See full description about this app [here](https://github.com/tsahiBarshevsky/save-the-date-app).
